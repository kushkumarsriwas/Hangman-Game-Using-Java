First things first, How to set up game in your PC??

Well follow the steps below:=
1. First install a Java IDE in your PC, in my case i have used IntelliJ that is not free but if 
   you want to go with free i will suggest you to go with BlueJ which is very easy to setup and 
   light weight software possibly run in any version of your OS.
2. Once you complete with the IDE Installation, copy the code from HangmanGame.java and paste it 
   to your IDE.
3. Before running the code make sure that the file name of your program is HangmanGame.java only,
   if you try to run the code with different file name this will never run the program.
4. Once you successfully run the code, Hangman Game interface(I have attached the Screenshot of
   that interface in this repository also, i.e. "Game Interface.png") will automatically open.
